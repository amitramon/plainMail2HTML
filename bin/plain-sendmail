# Shell script that replace 'sendmail' or similar commands that
# are used to send Email message piped into them.
#
# This script reads an Email message from the standard input, pipe it
# into 'plain2html' that adds a HTML component to it, and then pipe
# the resulting Email message into 'sendmail' (or to a similar tool).
#
# All this script does is designed piping the Email first through lbdb
# for fetching Email adresses it might contain. Actually it has
# nothing to do with HTML, but it is provided here as the 'plain'
# counterpart of the HTML Email filter.
