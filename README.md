# plainMail2HTML

## About

plainMail2HTML is a tool that creates and attaches a HTML part to an
email message that has just a text/plain part. It support working with
markup tools (in example, reStructuredText) so that the plain text may
contain markup formatting marks that would affect the generation of
the HTML part.

## Purpose

The purpose of using this tool is to enable sending email messages in
HTML format using email clients (MUA) that are textual (for instance,
Mutt). When working with Mutt, all one has to do is to replace the
normal definition of Mutt's `sendmail` configuration variable with a
definition that calls plain2html-mail.py. That way, when a mail is
sent from Mutt, it will be modified on the fly by appending to it a
HTML part, then it will be handed over to the normal sendmail command.

There might be a couple of reasons why one would like to do such a
thing. First, one may want to send a fancy message. The second
possible reason is what initiated the development of this tool. Many
people are reading their mail using web-mail clients. Many of these
clients fail, on some occasions, to display text/plain messages
correctly when the message is in a language that is written from right
to left, such as Arabic or Hebrew. For example, the alignment of text
in Gmail web-mail client depends on the language of the user
interface. If, for example, the UI language is English, and I have a
text/plain message written in Hebrew, the text would be left-aligned,
making it very inconvenient to read.

## How it works

The email can actually be a multipart/mixed message, and then it is
assumed to have a text/plain as the very first component. The tool
will then replace this component with a multipart/alternative
component containing the original text/plain part and a new text/html
part.

It is assumed that msg is generated by Mutt, with a known
structure. It is multipart/mixed, and the first component is a
text/plain message, encoded in utf-8 8-bit.  The first component is
replaced by a multipart/alternative message that contains the original
first component (text) and a HTML version of it.

## Quick-Start

This is for those who want to get up & running quickly.  Read on for
complete details.

1.  Unpack the tarball in its own directory. Make sure that the
    directory plain2html (the one containing this README file) is in
    your PYTHONPATH environment variable.

2.  For Mutt: edit your muttrc file. Usually it contain the following,
    or a similar, definition:

        set sendmail="/usr/lib/sendmail -oem -oi $@"

    Change this line to read:

        set sendmail="/path/to/this/tool/bin/plain2html-mail.py -- $@"

3.  Look at the tool settings.py file. You may need to edit the
    location of the HTML template (the template is in the templates
    directory of the installation). You might also have to edit the
    sendmail setting -- it should be the same definition that
    originally was in the muttrc file.
